The S3 connector lets you point the Knowledge Repository at an S3-compatible bucket (including Svahnar S3) so documents can be imported directly from your cloud storage. Uploaded documents are copied into Svahnar's storage for RAG indexing and retrieval.

## When to use

- Large archives of documents already stored in S3
- Regular sync from production backups

## Usage
- You have to provide file/folder path of your S3 file (pdf)
- AWS credentials like access key id, access key secret (use Keyvault for it)
- AWS region name e.g- us-east-1


## Notes

- Documents copied into Svahnar S3 can be downloaded by user (who have permission) unless the original connector or storage policy prevents downloads.
