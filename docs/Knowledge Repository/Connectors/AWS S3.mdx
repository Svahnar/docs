# AWS S3

Connect your Knowledge Repository directly to **Amazon S3** to ingest documents automatically.

This connector allows you to point to a specific file or folder in a cloud bucket.

## 💡 Core Concepts

Before configuring the connector, understand how the data flows.

### 1. Storage Sync vs. Indexing

When you connect an S3 bucket, SVAHNAR does two things:

1. **Copies** the targeted files from your S3 bucket into SVAHNAR's secure storage.
2. **Indexes** these files so your AI agents can search and retrieve information from them during conversations.

### 2. Security & Access

Documents imported via this connector become part of your Knowledge Repository.

* **Knowledge Repository Access:** Agents with access to this Knowledge Base can read these files.

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to securely link your S3 bucket.

### Prepare AWS Credentials

To access your bucket, SVAHNAR needs valid AWS credentials.

1. Log in to your AWS Console.
2. Create an IAM User with **Read** access (`s3:GetObject`, `s3:ListBucket`) to the target bucket.
3. Generate an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.

:::tip Use Keyvault
For security, do not hardcode your Secret Key. Store it in the **SVAHNAR Key Vault** and reference it in your configuration.

</Step>

### Identify Target Resource

Decide exactly what you want to import:

* **Specific File:** Points to a single document (e.g., `documents/policy_2024.pdf`).
* **Folder:** Points to a prefix (e.g., `backups/production/`). All valid documents within this folder will be indexed.
</Step>
<Step>

### Configure Connector

Provide the following details in your configuration:

* **S3 Path:** The file key or folder prefix.
* **Region:** The AWS region where your bucket resides (e.g., `us-east-1`).
* **Credentials:** Your Access Key and Secret Key.
</Step>

</Steps>

### 💡 Tip: Large Archives

This connector is ideal for:

* **Large Archives:** Importing legacy document stores without manual uploading.
* **Regular Syncs:** If your production system dumps logs or reports to S3, this connector keeps your AI agents up-to-date with the latest data. (Note: For Enterprise users, regular syncs are available as a paid feature.)

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

* **Access Denied (403)**
  * Verify the IAM user has `s3:GetObject` permissions for the specific files.
  * If syncing a folder, ensure `s3:ListBucket` is also allowed.


* **File Not Found**
  * Check the `s3_path`. S3 paths are case-sensitive.
  * Ensure there is no leading slash (`/`) in the path (e.g., use `myfolder/doc.pdf` instead of `/myfolder/doc.pdf`).


* **Region Mismatch**
  * If you see "Bucket not found" errors, verify that the `region_name` matches exactly where the bucket was created (e.g., `us-west-2` vs `us-east-1`).

## 💰 Additional Credit Consumption

The KnowledgeRepo tool consumes credits based on the number of pages in the documents it indexes. Each page (up to legal size) consumes one credit.
