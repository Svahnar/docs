Import pages and attachments from Confluence into the Knowledge Repository. This connector supports page hierarchy and attachments where allowed by Confluence permissions.

## When to use

* Centralizing internal documentation from Confluence into the Knowledge Repository for search, QA, or knowledge ops.
* Migrating documentation or creating an offline/read-only snapshot of a Confluence space.

## Notes

* Some Confluence spaces or pages may be restricted; connector access must have the necessary permissions.
* SVAHNAR does not store Confluence files permanently; it ingests (reads) the data directly from your Confluence instance during import.

## Usage

1. Prepare a Confluence account with appropriate API permissions (read access to the target space and pages).
2. Build the `ConfluenceData` configuration (below) with the Confluence base URL, token, and the target `space_key`.
3. Call the import endpoint of the Knowledge Repository connector (or run the connector tool) providing the `ConfluenceData` payload.
4. Monitor logs for pages that could not be fetched due to permissions, rate limits, or unsupported content types.

### Typical flow

* The connector lists pages in the given `space_key` and walks the page hierarchy.
* For each page, it optionally pulls labels, comments, and attachments depending on flags in the configuration.
* The connector normalizes content (optionally preserving newlines) and sends extracted text and metadata into the Knowledge Repository ingestion pipeline.


## Parameter reference

* `url`: Base URL of your Confluence instance. Examples: `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/wiki` or an on-prem Confluence like `https://confluence.internal.local`.

* `token` : Personal access token or API token used to authenticate the connector. Must be kept secret — provide via SVAHNAR Key Vault or a secure secret manager when possible.

* `space_key` : The Confluence space key to import (e.g., `ENG`, `HR`, `DOCS`). The connector will enumerate pages under this space.

* `username`: The username or service account email associated with `token`. Used for API calls and helpful in logs/audit.

* `keep_newlines` : When `true`, the connector preserves original newline characters from Confluence page content. When `false`, the connector collapses multiple newlines and normalizes whitespace to produce continuous paragraphs.

* `include_labels` : Whether to import Confluence page labels/tags as metadata. Labels are useful for filtering later.

* `include_comments` : Whether to import page comments as separate records or appended notes. Comments can be noisy; enable only if you need discussion history.

* `include_archived_content` : If `true` the connector will also include pages that are archived in the space (when Confluence exposes archived state via API).

* `include_restricted_content` : If `true`, the connector attempts to import pages that have view restrictions. The connector will only succeed for restricted pages if the authenticated token/user has access.

* `include_attachments` : Whether to download attachments (pdf, images, docs) referenced by pages. Attachments are fetched when permissions allow and can be stored/ingested according to your Knowledge Repository storage policy.

## Example payload

Provide the schema values in your ingestion call. (The connector expects a JSON or equivalent payload matching `ConfluenceData`.)

```json
{
  "url": "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/wiki",
  "token": "<REDACTED>",
  "space_key": "DOCS",
  "username": "svc-confluence@yourcompany.com",
  "keep_newlines": true,
  "include_labels": true,
  "include_comments": false,
  "include_archived_content": false,
  "include_restricted_content": false,
  "include_attachments": true
}
```

## Authentication & permissions

* Use a service account or API token with *read* access to the desired space.
* If you need to import restricted pages or attachments, ensure the service account has explicit access to those items.
* If you use Atlassian cloud, prefer using an API token tied to a service account rather than a personal token.

## Attachments handling

* When `include_attachments` is enabled the connector will attempt to download attachments for each page and attach them to the ingestion record (subject to permission and size limits).
* Very large attachments may be skipped or truncated depending on repository ingestion limits — check the connector logs for skipped files.

## Limitations & caveats

* Rate limiting: Confluence cloud enforces API rate limits. Expect import to throttle and possibly take longer for large spaces.
* Content formats: Some Confluence macros or embedded content may not render to plain text perfectly. The connector strips or attempts to resolve common macros but may leave placeholders for complex macros.
* Attachments and binary files: The connector can fetch attachments but does not convert proprietary file types automatically.

## Troubleshooting

* 401/403 errors: Check API token and service account permissions.
* Missing pages: Confirm `space_key` is correct and the token user has read access to those pages.
* Rate-limited imports: Retry with exponential backoff or import the space in smaller batches.
