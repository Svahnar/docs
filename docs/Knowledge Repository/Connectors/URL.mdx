Use the URL connector to import content directly from web pages. The connector crawls and ingests publicly-accessible web content and stores it in the Knowledge Repository for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) queries.

## When to use

- Quick ingestion of public documentation, blogs, or knowledge bases
- Periodic scraping of frequently-updated pages

## Usage
- Just provide the URL in form `https://yoururl.com`. It will scrape the page content if images are there then that will also scraped.
- For images it will use OCR to retrieve data

## Notes

- Ensure the target URLs allow crawling and scraping.
