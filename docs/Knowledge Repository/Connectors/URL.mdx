# URL Connector

Automatically ingest and index content from web pages to power your **Knowledge Repository**.

This connector crawls publicly accessible URLs, extracting both text and data from images (via OCR) to prepare it for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) queries.

## 💡 Core Concepts

To use this connector effectively, understand how it processes web content.

### 1. What does the URL Connector do?

Unlike the *Webpage Search* tool (which an agent uses actively during a conversation), the **URL Connector** is used to *pre-load* knowledge. It crawls a target URL, scrapes the content, and stores it in your vector database. This allows agents to answer questions based on that content later.

### 2. Intelligent OCR

This connector goes beyond simple text scraping. If the crawler encounters images (such as charts, screenshots, or infographics) on the webpage, it uses **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to extract the text embedded within those images, ensuring no context is lost.

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to add a web source to your Knowledge Repository.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Prepare the Source

Identify the URL you wish to ingest. This works best for:

* Public documentation sites.
* Company blogs or news pages.
* Static knowledge bases.
</Step>
<Step>

### Add Connector

In your Knowledge Repository configuration, select the **URL** connector type.

* **Input:** Provide the full URL string (e.g., `https://docs.svahnar.com`).
</Step>
<Step>

### Ingestion Process

Once triggered, the system will:

1. **Crawl:** Access the page.
2. **Extract:** Scrape HTML text and perform OCR on `<img>` tags.
3. **Index:** Chunk the data and store embeddings in the Knowledge Repository.

## 📚 Practical Recipes (Examples)

### Recipe 1: Documentation Knowledge Base

> **Use Case:** Creating a knowledge base from a product's documentation site so agents can answer technical support questions.

```yaml showLineNumbers
knowledge_repository:
  name: "Product_Docs_KB"
  connectors:
    - type: "URL"
      config:
        # The crawler will start here
        url: "https://docs.example.com/introduction"
        # Optional: recurring schedule for updates
        refresh_schedule: "daily" 

```

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

* **Content not appearing in RAG**
* Check if the URL is behind a login or firewall. The connector requires **public access**.
* Ensure the website allows crawling. Some sites block bots via `robots.txt` or Cloudflare challenges.


* **Poor OCR Results**
* OCR accuracy depends on image resolution. Low-quality screenshots may yield gibberish.
* Ensure the images on the target URL are not lazy-loaded in a way that prevents the crawler from seeing them.


* **Ingestion Failures**
* Verify the URL format includes the protocol (must be `https://` or `http://`).
