# URL Connector

Automatically ingest and index content from web pages to power your **Knowledge Repository**.

This connector crawls publicly accessible URLs, extracting both text and data from images (via OCR) to prepare it for Agentic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (A-RAG).

## 💡 Core Concepts

To use this connector effectively, understand how it processes web content.

### 1. What does the URL Connector do?

Unlike the *Webpage Search* tool (which an agent uses actively during a conversation), the **URL Connector** is used to *pre-load* knowledge. It crawls a target URL, scrapes the content, and stores it in your Knowledge Repository. This allows agents to answer questions based on that content later.

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to add a web source to your Knowledge Repository.

<Step>

### Prepare the Source

Identify the URL you wish to ingest. This works best for:

* Public documentation sites.
* Company docs, blogs, or news pages.
* Static knowledge bases.
</Step>
<Step>

### Add Connector

In your Knowledge Repository configuration, select the **URL** connector type.

* **Input:** Provide the full URL string (e.g., `https://docs.svahnar.com`).
</Step>

### Ingestion Process

Once triggered, the system will:

1. **Crawl:** Access the page.
2. **Extract:** Scrape HTML text and perform OCR on `<img>` tags.
3. **Index:** Chunk the data and store embeddings in the Knowledge Repository.

</Step>

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

* **Content not appearing in RAG**
    * Check if the URL is behind a login or firewall. The connector requires **public access**.
    * Ensure the website allows crawling. Some sites block bots via `robots.txt` or Cloudflare challenges.


* **Poor OCR Results**
    * OCR accuracy depends on image resolution. Low-quality screenshots may yield gibberish.
    * Ensure the images on the target URL are not lazy-loaded in a way that prevents the crawler from seeing them.


* **Ingestion Failures**
    * Verify the URL format includes the protocol (must be `https://` or `http://`).

## 💰 Additional Credit Consumption

Extracted information is processed into pages of size A4 (8.5" x 11"). Each page consumes one credit.
