---

The Knowledge Repository (KR) lets you add documents (PDFs only) to a knowledge repository so agents can interact with that content.

## Key capabilities

- Documents you add are indexed so the Agents can retrieve, analyze, and answer queries grounded in the document content rather than hallucinating. KRs enables concise, accurate answers drawn from the source material.
-  Users can download stored documents unless a specific connector (except confluence and sharepoint) from a KR.

- You can connect documents that already live in cloud services using SVAHNAR connectors so they are indexed without manual re-upload.
- OCR capabilities:- It will perform OCR on pdfs created from images to extract textual data from it

### How it works (short)

1. Ingest: Upload documents directly or connect external sources (URL, S3, Confluence, SharePoint).
2. Index: The repository preprocesses and indexes content for semantic search and retrieval.
3. Query: Agents use KR to fetch relevant passages and produce accurate answers that reference the original documents.


## Connectors

You can connect external document sources so the Knowledge Repository indexes them automatically. As of now, SVAHNAR supports the following connectors:

- [URL](/docs/Knowledge%20Repository/Connectors/URL.mdx)
- [AWS S3](/docs/Knowledge%20Repository/Connectors/AWS%20S3)
- [Confluence](/docs/Knowledge%20Repository/Connectors/Confluence)
- [SharePoint](/docs/Knowledge%20Repository/Connectors/Sharepoint)

Tips and best practices

- Upload canonical, versioned copies of documents when possible to avoid indexing transient drafts.
