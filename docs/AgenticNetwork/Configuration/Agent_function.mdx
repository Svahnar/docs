title: "Agent Functions"
---

The `agent_function` field defines the purpose and behavior of each agent within the network. It specifies what tasks the agent is responsible for and guides its operations.

## Why are Agent Functions Important?

- **Clarity of Purpose**: Clearly defines what an agent does.
- **Behavioral Guidance**: Instructs the agent on how to perform its tasks.
- **Coordination**: Helps other agents understand the capabilities of their peers.

## Defining Agent Functions

Agent functions are defined using the `agent_function` field, which takes an array of strings describing the functions.

### Example:

- **Stock_news_searcher**:

  ```yaml showLineNumbers
  agent_function:
    - "Your function is to search the web or the internet for the latest news about given companies and the stock market, including all relevant news articles and official filings."
  ```

- **sms_sender**:

  ```yaml showLineNumbers
  agent_function:
    - "You can send SMS messages to the user using Twilio."
  ```

- **my_supervisor**:

  ```yaml showLineNumbers title="index.js"
  agent_function:
    - "You are the supervisor of the agents defined in outgoing edges."
  ```

## Explanation:

- Descriptive statements that instruct the agent on its role.
- Helps in tailoring the agent's behavior during execution.

## Best Practices:

- **Be Specific**: Clearly state what the agent should do.
- **Use Action Verbs**: Start functions with verbs like "Search", "Send", "Process".
- **Limit Scope**: Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.

## Visualization Suggestion

Include a **use case diagram** or **activity diagram** that shows the functions of each agent.

- **Diagram Type**: Activity Diagram.
- **Description**: Visual representation of the agent's tasks and decision points.

### Example:

- **Stock_news_searcher**:
  - Start → Search for news → Compile results → End

Defining clear agent functions ensures that each agent operates as intended, contributing effectively to the overall network.
