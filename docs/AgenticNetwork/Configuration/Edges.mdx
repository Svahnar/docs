title: "Incoming and Outgoing Edges"
---


In the Agentic Network, **edges** define the communication pathways and data flow between agents. They determine how agents are triggered and interact with one another.

## Defining Edges

Each agent specifies edges using the `incoming_edge` and `outgoing_edge` fields:

### Incoming Edge (`incoming_edge`)

- Specifies agents or signals that trigger the agent.
- Can include the special signal `"Start"` to signify the network's entry point.

### Outgoing Edge (`outgoing_edge`)

- Specifies agents that receive data or are triggered by the current agent.
- Must reference valid agent names defined in the network.

## Example Edges Configuration

### For `my_supervisor`

```yaml showLineNumbers
incoming_edge:
  - "Start"
  - "Stock_news_searcher"
  - "sms_sender"
outgoing_edge:
  - "Stock_news_searcher"
  - "sms_sender"
```

### For `Stock_news_searcher`

```yaml showLineNumbers
incoming_edge:
  - "my_supervisor"
outgoing_edge:
  - "my_supervisor"
```

### For `sms_sender`

```yaml showLineNumbers
incoming_edge:
  - "my_supervisor"
outgoing_edge:
  - "my_supervisor"
```

## Understanding the Workflow

- **`my_supervisor` Agent**:
  - Triggered by the `"Start"` signal.
  - Sends tasks to `Stock_news_searcher` and `sms_sender`.
  - Receives inputs from `Stock_news_searcher` and `sms_sender`.
- **`Stock_news_searcher` and `sms_sender` Agents**:
  - Triggered by `my_supervisor`.
  - Perform their functions and send results back to `my_supervisor`.

## Importance of Edges

- **Controls Execution Flow**: Manages the sequence of agent operations.
- **Enables Communication**: Facilitates data exchange between agents.
- **Defines Network Topology**: Establishes how agents are connected.

## Edge Configuration Rules

- **Valid References**: Edges must reference existing agents or the `"Start"` signal.
- **Single Start**: Only one agent should have `"Start"` in its `incoming_edge`.
- **Supervisor Constraints**: Supervisor agents must only connect to agents defined earlier in the YAML file.

## Visual Representation

Create a network diagram:

- **Nodes**: Represent agents.
- **Edges**: Directed arrows indicating `outgoing_edge` connections.
- **Start Signal**: Denote the starting point.

By carefully configuring edges, you orchestrate the flow of tasks and data within the Agentic Network, ensuring agents interact seamlessly to achieve your objectives.
