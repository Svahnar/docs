Learn how to build your first autonomous agent that can search the internet using the SVAHNAR framework.

This guide walks you through configuring a basic **Web Search** agent. The agent will use a Large Language Model (LLM) to reason, tools to access live data, and a natural language instruction to execute its task.

## 💡 Core Concepts

Before writing the configuration, it is helpful to understand the structure of a SVAHNAR agent.

### 1. The Agent Network
Every agent lives inside a network container. The top-level key `create_agent_network` defines this boundary. Think of it as the "team" that your agent belongs to.

Even a single agent exists inside a `create_agent_network` block. This allows you to easily scale from one agent to many without rewriting your code.

### 2. The Agent "Anatomy"
A simple agent requires four key components to function:
* **LLM Config:** The "Brain" (e.g., GPT-5).
* **Tools:** The "Hands" (e.g., Web Search).
* **Function:** The "Mission" (Instructions in plain English).
* **Edges:** The "Flow" (When to start and stop).

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to build your agent from scratch using YAML.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Initialize the Network

First, define the network container and your agent's ID.

* **`create_agent_network`**: The root of your configuration.
* **`agent-1`**: A unique ID for the agent within this network.
* **`agent_name`**: A human-readable name (e.g., "Web_search").

```yaml showLineNumbers
create_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: "Web_search"
```

For deep dives on network structure, see  [Initialization](/docs/AgenticNetwork/Configuration/Initialization).

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure the "Brain" (LLM)
Next, specify which model powers the agent. You can control parameters like max_tokens (response length) and request_timeout (patience).

```YAML showLineNumbers
LLM_config:
  params:
    model: "gpt-5"
    max_tokens: 1000
    request_timeout: 600
```

:::info
See the full list of supported models in [LLM Configuration](/docs/AgenticNetwork/Configuration/LLM).

</Step>

### Equip Tools
Give your agent capabilities beyond standard text generation. Here, we assign the Tavily tool to enable internet access.
``` YAML showLineNumbers
tools:
  tool_assigned:
    - name: "Tavily"
      config:
        max_results: 5
        API_key: abcd # or API_key: ${TAVILY_API_KEY}
```
max_results: Limits the search tool to the top 5 most relevant links to ensure concise answers.

:::info
Explore other available tools in the [Tools Documentation](/docs/AgenticNetwork/Configuration/Tools).
:::

</Step>

<Step>

### Define the Mission
Tell the agent what to do using natural language in the agent_function block.
``` YAML showLineNumbers
agent_function:
  - "Your function is to search the web or internet for information"
```
:::tip
Pro Tip Be specific. The clearer your instruction, the better the agent performs. Learn more in [Agent Function Documentation](/docs/AgenticNetwork/Configuration/Agent_function).
:::

</Step>

<Step>

### Set the Flow (Edges)
Finally, define how the agent connects to the rest of the world.

#### incoming_edge: 
We use "Start"(case-sensitive) to indicate this agent runs immediately when the application launches.

#### outgoing_edge: 
We leave this empty [] because this is a simple, standalone agent that doesn't pass work to anyone else.
```yaml showLineNumbers
    incoming_edge:
      - "Start"
    outgoing_edge: []
```
:::info
To build complex workflows with multiple agents, read about [Incoming and Outgoing Edges](/docs/AgenticNetwork/Configuration/Edges).

## 📚 Practical Recipes (Examples)
Full Web Search Agent
Use Case: A standalone agent that accepts a user query, searches the web, and returns a summary.

```yaml showLineNumbers create_first_agent.yaml
create_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: "Web_search"
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: "gpt-5"
          max_tokens: 1000
          request_timeout: 600
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: "Tavily"
          config:
            max_results: 5
            API_key: abcd # or API_key: ${TAVILY_API_KEY}
    agent_function:
      - "Your function is to search the web or internet for information"
    incoming_edge:
      - "Start"
    outgoing_edge: []
```

### 🚑 Troubleshooting
* Agent not starting?
  * Ensure incoming_edge is set to ["Start"] (case-sensitive). Without this, the agent waits for a signal that never comes.

* Search failing?
  * Verify you have configured your Tavily API Key in your YAML configuration file or Key Vault.

* YAML Syntax Errors?
  * Check your indentation. YAML is whitespace-sensitive; ensure nested keys (like params under LLM_config) are indented correctly.
