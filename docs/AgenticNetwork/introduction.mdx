The **Svahnar Agentic Framework** is a powerful framework designed to empower not only developers but also anyone to create intelligent, intentional, and effective computational systems. The framework enables you to deploy **Agentic AI**, which are systems that can **think**, **learn**, and **act** independently to achieve defined goals and purposes.

With the **Svahnar Agentic AI Framework**, you can:

- **Integrate** with various tools (Knowledge Repositories support coming in the next release).
- **Define** specific behaviors and intentions for AI agents.
- **Connect** to leading Foundation Models, Agents and Guardrails.

Whether you're building **automated workflows**, **decision-making systems**, or **state-of-the-art intelligent agents**, the Svahnar Framework simplifies the process of designing, deploying, and scaling Agentic AI solutions.

## What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to computational systems that operate with a level of **autonomy**, **intelligence**, and **purpose**. Unlike traditional AI systems that simply process inputs and respond with outputs based on predefined rules, Agentic AI is designed to:

- **Perceive**  its environment, tools, knowledge repositories, and external contexts by gathering and processing data, extracting meaningful features, and identifying relevant entities.
- **Reason** through orchestration. Using Agentic Network, it interprets tasks, develops intelligent solutions, and coordinates with other agents for specific functionalities such as content creation, analysis, and personalized recommendations.
- **Act**  intentionally to achieve specific objectives by executing tasks based on crafted plans. Through integration with external tools and APIs, Agentic AI can ensure accurate, goal-driven operations while leveraging built-in guardrails to maintain control and correctness.
- **Learn** dynamically from data over time by incorporating interaction feedback into its models, enabling it to adapt, optimize performance, and enhance decision-making efficacy.

This makes Agentic AI particularly useful for use cases where independent decision-making, dynamic workflows, or autonomous control systems are required.

## YAML Configuration for Svahnar Agentic Network

The **Svahnar Agentic AI Framework** offers a convenient way to create agentic networks using **YAML configuration files** and **SVAHNAR Console**. YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) provides a human-readable way to define the structure, data, and behaviors of your Agentic AI network. Creating an Agentic AI system using YAML ensures simplicity, clarity, and flexibility.

### Starting Your YAML Configuration

Every YAML configuration file for creating a Svahnar Agentic Network must include the **top-level key**:

```yaml showLineNumbers starting_point.yaml
create_vertical_agent_network:
```

This top-level key serves as the **starting point** for defining every aspect of the Agentic AI network. Within this key, you will organize all the critical components required to configure and operate the agentic network effectively, including:

- **Defining agent function**
- **Connecting to Foundation models**
- **Data and tools integration**
- **Orchestration of Agent interactions**

The YAML-based approach enables you to craft fully customized Agentic AI frameworks with ease. By nesting configurations under the `create_vertical_agent_network` key, you ensure that all components are logically structured and easy to manage.
