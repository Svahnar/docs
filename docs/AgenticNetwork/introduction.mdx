# Introduction to SVAHNAR

The **SVAHNAR Agentic AI Framework** is designed to empower both developers and non-technical users to build intelligent, autonomous AI systems.

Unlike traditional automation, SVAHNAR enables you to deploy **Agentic AI**—systems that can **think**, **learn**, and **act** independently to achieve your goals.

With this framework, you can:
* **Connect** to leading Foundation Models (LLMs).
* **Integrate** seamlessly with external tools and APIs.
* **Define** strict guardrails (Do's and Don'ts) for safety.

## 💡 Core Concepts

Before building, it is helpful to understand what sets Agentic AI apart from standard automation.

### What is Agentic AI?

Traditional AI waits for a prompt to give an answer. **Agentic AI** operates with autonomy and purpose. It is designed to:

1.  **Perceive:** Collects and understands data from its environment, tools, and knowledge repositories.
2.  **Reason:** Plans a path to a solution. It figures out which tools to use and breaks down complex problems into manageable steps.
3.  **Act:** Executes its plans using external tools (like APIs, Databases, or Search) while adhering to defined safeguards.
4.  **Learn:** Improves over time by utilizing feedback loops to refine its decision-making.

## ⚙️ Configuration Approach

SVAHNAR uses a **YAML-first approach**. 

We chose YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) because it is human-readable. This allows everyone to "read" the structure of an AI agent and understand its behavior without needing to deal with complex code.

:::tip Power & Flexibility
You do not lose features or flexibility by using YAML. You retain the same level of granular control as you would with Python or JavaScript.
:::

:::info Agent Console 
You can also use our **Agent Console** to create Agents without writing YAML files directly.

Log in to the [SVAHNAR Platform](https://platform.svahnar.com/) and navigate to the **Agent Console** on the top bar to create your first Agent.

### The Foundation Key

Every Agentic Network you build begins with a single, top-level key. This tells the framework that you are defining a network of agents.

```yaml showLineNumbers title="starting_point.yaml"
create_agent_network:
  # All your agent configurations, tools, and logic reside here
