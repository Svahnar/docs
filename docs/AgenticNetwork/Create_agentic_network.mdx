In this guide, we'll learn how to create an **Agentic Network** using the Svahnar Agentic AI Framework. This network will consist of multiple agents working together to perform complex tasks, such as fetching stock market news and sending SMS notifications. We'll walk through the YAML configuration step by step, explaining each component and how they interconnect.

## Example YAML Configuration

Below is the example YAML configuration for the Agentic Network:

```yaml
create_vertical_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: "Stock_news_searcher"
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: "gpt-4o-mini"
          temperature: 0.0
          max_tokens: 1000
          request_timeout: 600
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: "YahooFinanceNewsTool"
    agent_function:
      - "Your function is to search the web or the internet for the latest news about given companies and the stock market, including all relevant news articles and official filings."
    incoming_edge:
      - "my_supervisor"
    outgoing_edge:
      - "my_supervisor"

  agent-2:
    agent_name: "sms_sender"
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: "gpt-4o-mini"
          temperature: 0.0
          max_tokens: 1000
          request_timeout: 600
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: "Twilio_sms"
          config:
            to: "<recipient_phone_number>"
            from_: "<twilio_phone_number>"
    agent_function:
      - "You can send SMS messages to the user using Twilio."
    incoming_edge:
      - "my_supervisor"
    outgoing_edge:
      - "my_supervisor"

  agent-3:
    agent_name: "my_supervisor"
    Role: "supervisor"
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: "gpt-4o-mini"
          temperature: 0.0
          max_tokens: 1000
          request_timeout: 600
    agent_function:
      - "You are the supervisor of the agents defined in outgoing edges."
    incoming_edge:
      - "Start"
      - "Stock_news_searcher"
      - "sms_sender"
    outgoing_edge:
      - "Stock_news_searcher"
      - "sms_sender"
```

This configuration defines an Agentic Network with three agents:

- **agent-1 ("Stock_news_searcher")**: Searches for the latest stock market news.
- **agent-2 ("sms_sender")**: Sends SMS messages with the news updates.
- **agent-3 ("my_supervisor")**: Supervises the agents and coordinates their activities.



<Steps titleSize="h2">
<Step title="Initialize the Agentic Network">

Begin by defining the top-level key `create_vertical_agent_network` to initialize the Agentic Network. Under this key, you'll define each agent with a unique identifier.

```yaml
create_vertical_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: "Stock_news_searcher"
  agent-2:
    agent_name: "sms_sender"
  agent-3:
    agent_name: "my_supervisor"
    Role: "supervisor"
```

This sets up the basic structure of your network, establishing each agent by a unique `agent_name`.

The `Role` of `"supervisor"` for `my_supervisor` indicates that this agent oversees and coordinates other agents.

For detailed information, refer to the [Initialization Documentation](/AgenticNetwork/configuration/initialization).

</Step>
<Step title="Configure LLMs for Each Agent">

Each agent requires an LLM configuration to handle reasoning:

```yaml
LLM_config:
    params:
      model: "gpt-4o-mini"
      temperature: 0.0
      max_tokens: 1000
      request_timeout: 600
```

- **model**: Indicates the model variant to use.
- **temperature**: Controls output randomness; `0.0` ensures deterministic responses.
- **max_tokens**: Sets the maximum length of the response.
- **request_timeout**: The maximum time to wait for a response from the LLM.

Apply this configuration to each agent to ensure consistent reasoning capabilities.

For more details, visit the [LLM Configuration Documentation](/AgenticNetwork/configuration/llm).


</Step>
<Step title="Assign Tools to Agents">

Agents can be equipped with tools to enhance their functionality.

- **Stock_news_searcher** uses the `YahooFinanceNewsTool` to fetch financial news.

  ```yaml
  tools:
    tool_assigned:
      - name: "YahooFinanceNewsTool"
  ```

- **sms_sender** uses the `Twilio_sms` tool to send SMS messages.

  ```yaml
  tools:
    tool_assigned:
      - name: "Twilio_sms"
        config:
          to: "<recipient_phone_number>"
          from_: "<twilio_phone_number>"
  ```

  **Note**: Replace `<recipient_phone_number>` and `<twilio_phone_number>` with actual phone numbers formatted with the country code (e.g., "+1234567890").

These tools enable agents to interact with external services, such as fetching data or communicating with users.

For additional information, check out the [Tools Documentation](/AgenticNetwork/configuration/tools).

</Step>
<Step title="Define Agent Functions">


Specify the purpose and role of each agent using `agent_function` and, if applicable, `Role`.

- **Stock_news_searcher**:

  ```yaml
  agent_function:
    - "Your function is to search the web or the internet for the latest news about given companies and the stock market, including all relevant news articles and official filings."
  ```

- **sms_sender**:

  ```yaml
  agent_function:
    - "You can send SMS messages to the user using Twilio."
  ```

- **my_supervisor**:

  ```yaml
  agent_function:
    - "You are the supervisor of the agents defined in outgoing edges."
  ```

Explore more about defining agent functions at [Agent Function Documentation](/AgenticNetwork/configuration/agent-function).

</Step>
<Step title="Establish Inter-Agent Communication with Edges">


Configure how agents communicate and trigger each other using `incoming_edge` and `outgoing_edge`.

- **Stock_news_searcher**:

  ```yaml
  incoming_edge:
    - "my_supervisor"
  outgoing_edge:
    - "my_supervisor"
  ```

- **sms_sender**:

  ```yaml
  incoming_edge:
    - "my_supervisor"
  outgoing_edge:
    - "my_supervisor"
  ```

- **my_supervisor**:

  ```yaml
  incoming_edge:
    - "Start"
    - "Stock_news_searcher"
    - "sms_sender"
  outgoing_edge:
    - "Stock_news_searcher"
    - "sms_sender"
  ```

Explanation:

- **Incoming Edges**: Define which agents or signals trigger this agent.
- **Outgoing Edges**: Define which agents this agent can communicate with after execution.

The supervisor agent (`my_supervisor`) starts the process and coordinates between the agents.

Learn more about edges at the [Incoming and Outgoing Edges Documentation](/AgenticNetwork/configuration/incoming-outgoing-edges).

</Step>
<Step title="Finalize the YAML Configuration">


Combine all the components to finalize your Agentic Network configuration:

```yaml
create_vertical_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: "Stock_news_searcher"
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: "gpt-4o-mini"
          temperature: 0.0
          max_tokens: 1000
          request_timeout: 600
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: "YahooFinanceNewsTool"
    agent_function:
      - "Your function is to search the web or the internet for the latest news about given companies and the stock market, including all relevant news articles and official filings."
    incoming_edge:
      - "my_supervisor"
    outgoing_edge:
      - "my_supervisor"

  agent-2:
    agent_name: "sms_sender"
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: "gpt-4o-mini"
          temperature: 0.0
          max_tokens: 1000
          request_timeout: 600
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: "Twilio_sms"
          config:
            to: "<recipient_phone_number>"
            from_: "<twilio_phone_number>"
    agent_function:
      - "You can send SMS messages to the user using Twilio."
    incoming_edge:
      - "my_supervisor"
    outgoing_edge:
      - "my_supervisor"

  agent-3:
    agent_name: "my_supervisor"
    Role: "supervisor"
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: "gpt-4o-mini"
          temperature: 0.0
          max_tokens: 1000
          request_timeout: 600
    agent_function:
      - "You are the supervisor of the agents defined in outgoing edges."
    incoming_edge:
      - "Start"
      - "Stock_news_searcher"
      - "sms_sender"
    outgoing_edge:
      - "Stock_news_searcher"
      - "sms_sender"
```

Your Agentic Network is now fully configured and ready to deploy. The agents will work together as follows:

- The **supervisor agent** initiates the process upon the `Start` signal.
- It delegates tasks to the **Stock_news_searcher** and **sms_sender** agents through the specified edges.
- The **Stock_news_searcher** retrieves the latest stock market news.
- The **sms_sender** sends the news updates via SMS to the specified recipient.
