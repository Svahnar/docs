## 📚 Practical Recipes (Examples)

### Recipe 1: Research & Summarizer Agent

> **Use Case:** An agent that takes a URL from a user, reads the content, and provides a summary.

```yaml showLineNumbers
create_vertical_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: Researcher_Agent
    LLM_config:
      params:
        model: gpt-4o
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: webpage_search
    agent_function:
      - You are a research assistant.
      - When a user provides a link, use the webpage_search tool to read it.
      - Summarize the key points of the content found in the URL.
    incoming_edge:
      - Start
    outgoing_edge: []

```

### 💡 Note: Handling Large Pages

If a webpage is extremely large, downstream tools or LLM context windows might truncate the text.

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

* **"Missing required field: 'urls'"**
    * The agent failed to provide the target link. Ensure your prompt explicitly instructs the agent to "pass the 'urls' argument."


* **Empty or Garbled Output**
    * The website might have anti-scraping blocks (403 Forbidden).


* **Error in scraping webpage**
  * Check if the URL is valid and publicly accessible.
