# Twilio SMS

Instantly send SMS notifications and alerts from your agents using **Twilio**.

This guide will walk you through setting up Twilio integration, configuring the required credentials, and sending your first message.

## 💡 Core Concepts

To configure this tool, you need to understand two key components.

### 1. How does the Twilio SMS Tool work?

The Twilio SMS tool allows your agent to send text messages to mobile phones globally.

### 2. What are the Twilio Credentials?

You need three pieces of information from your Twilio console to authorize the agent:
* **Account SID (`TWILIO_SID`):** Your unique account identifier.
* **Auth Token (`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`):** Your secret key for API access.
* **Twilio Phone Number (`from`):** A number purchased or assigned in your Twilio account that is capable of sending SMS.

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to integrate Twilio SMS into your agent network.

<Steps>
  <Step>

### Get Twilio Credentials

  1. Log in to your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/).
  2. Copy your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** from the dashboard.
  3. Navigate to **Phone Numbers** and copy the active number you wish to send messages from.

  </Step>

  <Step>

### Configure Agent Tools

  1.  **Assign the Tool**:
      * In your agent's YAML configuration, add `Twilio_sms` to the `tool_assigned` list.
  2.  **Set Credentials**:
      * Add your credentials in the `config` block.
      * *Security Note:* It is highly recommended to use SVAHNAR Key Vault (e.g., `${TWILIO_SID}`) rather than hardcoding secrets directly in the YAML.

  :::info
  You can pre-define the `to` and `from` numbers in the config if your agent always messages the same recipient or uses the same sender ID.

### Define Agent Function

  Give your agent a clear instruction on when to send an SMS.

## 📚 Practical Recipes (Examples)

### Recipe 1: Basic SMS Notification Agent

> **Use Case:** An agent that sends a critical alert to a specific admin number when triggered.

```yaml showLineNumbers
create_vertical_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: alert_agent
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: gpt-4o
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: Twilio_sms
          config:
            # Twilio Credentials (use env vars for security)
            TWILIO_SID: ${TWILIO_SID}
            TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: ${TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN}
            # The Twilio number sending the SMS
            from: "+15550109988"
            # Optional: Hardcode the recipient if it's always the same
            to: "+15550199999"
    agent_function:
      - You are a monitoring assistant. When asked to send an alert, use the Twilio tool to send the message immediately.
    incoming_edge:
      - Start
    outgoing_edge: []

```

### 💡 Tip: Dynamic Payloads

If you don't hardcode `to`, `from`, or `body` in the config, the agent will dynamically generate them based on the context.

* **Dynamic Recipient:** "Send a text to +1555... saying 'Hello'."
* **Dynamic Body:** "Text the admin the current summary of the report."

---

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

* **Missing Required Fields**
    * Ensure the agent or the config provides all three: `to` (recipient), `from` (sender), and `body` (message text).


* **Authentication Failed**
    * Verify your `TWILIO_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` are correct.
    * Ensure SVAHNAR Key Vault is correctly configured if using `${...}` syntax.


* **Invalid Phone Numbers**
    * Use **E.164 format** for all phone numbers (e.g., `+1234567890` or `+919876543210`).
    * Ensure the `from` number is a valid, active Twilio number capable of sending SMS.


* **Message Not Sent**
    * The tool returns the **Twilio SID** on success. If you don't see an SID in the tool response, the message likely failed at the API level.
