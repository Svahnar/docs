sidebarTitle: List of Tools

A multifunction GitHub tool to read, write, update, delete files, list files, create issues, and open pull requests in your provided repository.

## Authentication

Tool config must include `repo` (owner/repo) and `PRIVATE_KEY` (GitHub App private key). Optionally provide `APP_ID` and `Branch`.

## Operations

- `read_file`: Return file contents.
- `write_file`: Create a new file (supply `file_query`).
- `update_file`: Update file using `update_file_query` format.
- `delete_file`: Delete a file.
- `list_files_in_bot_branch`: List files in the bot branch.
- Issue and PR operations are supported as well.

## YAML usage

```yaml
tools:
  tool_assigned:
    - name: "GitHubTool"
      config:
        repo: "owner/repo"
        PRIVATE_KEY: "${GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY}"
        APP_ID: "123456"
        Branch: "main"
```

Invocation payload examples

Read a file

```yaml
payload:
	operation: "read_file"
	file_path: "README.md"
```

Create a new file

```yaml
payload:
	operation: "write_file"
	file_query: "/docs/newfile.md\nNew content here"
```

### More details

This tool uses a GitHub App private key for authentication. Keep keys secure and avoid embedding them directly in YAML stored in source control. Responses may include SystemMessage objects instructing the agent not to call the tool again when a write/create operation completes.

## Agent integration example

```yaml
create_vertical_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: "repo_agent"
    LLM_config:
      params:
        model: "gpt-4o-mini"
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: "GitHubTool"
          config:
            repo: "owner/repo"
            PRIVATE_KEY: "${GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY}"
    agent_function:
      - "Perform repository read/write operations as requested."
```
