A multifunction GitHub tool to read, write, update, delete files, list files, create issues, and open pull requests in your provided repository.

## Authentication

Tool config must include `repo` (owner/repo), `APP_ID` and `PRIVATE_KEY` (GitHub App private key). Optionally provide `Branch`.

## Operations

- `read_file`: Return file contents.
- `write_file`: Create a new file (supply `file_query`).
- `update_file`: Update file using `update_file_query` format.
- `delete_file`: Delete a file.
- `list_files_in_bot_branch`: List files in the bot branch.
- Issue and PR operations are supported as well.

## Usage
1. Create a Github App
[Follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) to create and register a Github app. Make sure your app has the following repository permissions:

- Commit statuses (read only)
- Contents (read and write)
- Issues (read and write)
- Metadata (read only)
- Pull requests (read and write)
- Once the app has been registered, you must give your app permission to access each of the repositories you whish it to act upon. Use the App settings on github.com here.

2. Required parameters
Before initializing your agent, the following environment variables need to be set:

- GITHUB_APP_ID- A six digit number found in your app's general settings
- GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY- The private key present in .pem file, full text of that file content as a string.
- GITHUB_REPOSITORY- The name of the Github repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format `username/reponame`. Make sure the app has been added to this repository first!
- Optional: GITHUB_BRANCH- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to main.


## YAML usage

```yaml showLineNumbers
tools:
  tool_assigned:
    - name: "GitHubTool"
      config:
        repo: "owner/repo"
        PRIVATE_KEY: "${GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY}"
        APP_ID: "123456"
        Branch: "main"
```

Invocation payload examples

Read a file

```yaml showLineNumbers
payload:
	operation: "read_file"
	file_path: "README.md"
```

Create a new file

```yaml showLineNumbers
payload:
	operation: "write_file"
	file_query: "/docs/newfile.md\nNew content here"
```

### More details

This tool uses a GitHub App private key for authentication. Keep keys secure and avoid embedding them directly in YAML stored in source control. Responses may include SystemMessage objects instructing the agent not to call the tool again when a write/create operation completes.

## Agent integration example

```yaml showLineNumbers
create_vertical_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: "repo_agent"
    LLM_config:
      params:
        model: "gpt-5-mini"
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: "GitHubTool"
          config:
            repo: "owner/repo"
            PRIVATE_KEY: "${GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY}"
    agent_function:
      - "Perform repository read/write operations as requested."
```
