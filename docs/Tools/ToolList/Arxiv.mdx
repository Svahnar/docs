# Arxiv

Access the open-access archive for 2 million+ scholarly articles in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, and more.

This tool allows your agents to search for preprints, summaries, and authors to ground their answers in scientific research.

## 💡 Core Concepts

The **Arxiv** tool is straightforward:
1.  **Configuration**: You can (optionally) set limits on how many results to return or how much text to fetch.
2.  **Querying**: The agent sends a search term to find relevant papers.

## ⚙️ Configuration Reference

### Tool Configuration (`config`)

These parameters control the behavior of the ArXiv wrapper and are set in your YAML.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`top_k_results`** | int | `3` | The maximum number of papers to return for a single query. |
| **`load_max_docs`** | int | `3` | Same as `top_k_results`. Limits the number of documents loaded. |
| **`doc_content_chars_max`** | int | `4000` | The maximum number of characters to read from the abstract/summary. Useful for saving tokens. |
| **`load_all_available_meta`** | bool | `False` | If true, loads extra metadata (DOI, published date, etc.) beyond just the summary. |

## 📚 Practical Recipes (Examples)

### Recipe 1: Basic Research Assistant
> **Use Case:** A general-purpose researcher that finds the top 3 papers.

```yaml showLineNumbers
create_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: Researcher
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: gpt-5-nano
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: Arxiv
          config:
            top_k_results: 3
    agent_function:
      - "Search Arxiv for papers on specific topics when asked."
```

### Recipe 2: Deep Dive (More Content)
> **Use Case:** When you need more details from the abstracts and more papers.

```yaml showLineNumbers
create_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: DeepResearcher
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: Arxiv
          config:
            top_k_results: 10
            load_max_docs: 10
            doc_content_chars_max: 10000
```

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

*   **Empty Results**
    *   The query might be too specific or contain typos. ArXiv search can be sensitive.
    *   Try broadening the search terms.

*   **Rate Limits**
    *   The ArXiv API has rate limits. If you make too many requests quickly, you might be temporarily blocked. The wrapper handles some retries, but be mindful of loop usage.
