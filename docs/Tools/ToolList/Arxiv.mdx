Arxiv is an open-access archive of scholarly articles and research papers across fields such as physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering & systems science, and economics.

This tool wraps the ArXiv API to allow agents to search for recent and relevant preprints by query. It is suitable for research, literature discovery, and citation lookup.

## Usage

Add the Arxiv tool to an agent's `tools.tool_assigned` list. The minimum required payload is a `query` string. The tool returns a list of matching paper metadata and snippets.

```yaml
tools:
	tool_assigned:
		- name: "Arxiv"
```

### Example payload

```json
{ "query": "neural network interpretability" }
```

### Notes

- The tool requires only a `query` parameter in the payload (or in the merged tool config).
- Results are returned by the underlying Arxiv API wrapper. Adjustments to paging or result count can be done via tool config if supported by your environment.

For programmatic examples and advanced parameters, see the tool implementation in the codebase.

## YAML usage

Example `tools` section to assign the Arxiv tool to an agent (no params required by default):

```yaml
tools:
	tool_assigned:
		- name: "Arxiv"
```

To call the tool from an agent runtime, send a payload with a `query` key:

```yaml
payload:
	query: "neural network interpretability"

## Agent integration example

Below is an example `create_vertical_agent_network` snippet showing how to attach the Arxiv tool to an agent in the same style used by the Agentic Network docs:

```yaml
create_vertical_agent_network:
	agent-1:
		agent_name: "paper_searcher"
		LLM_config:
			params:
				model: "gpt-4o-mini"
				temperature: 0.0
		tools:
			tool_assigned:
				- name: "Arxiv"
		agent_function:
			- "Search arXiv for papers matching a query and return titles and abstracts."
		incoming_edge: ["my_supervisor"]
		outgoing_edge: ["my_supervisor"]
```

This places the tool on a named agent so it can be called as part of the agent execution flow.
