# Wikipedia

Empower your agents to access the world's knowledge by searching **Wikipedia** for article summaries and historical data.

This guide will walk you through configuring the Wikipedia tool, including how to customize search depth and language settings.

## 💡 Core Concepts

To configure this tool, you need to understand how it handles queries and parameters.

### 1. How does the Wikipedia Tool work?

This tool acts as a wrapper around the Wikipedia API. When your agent sends a `query`, the tool searches for relevant articles, retrieves the most pertinent pages, and returns a concise summary of the content.

### 2. Configuration Parameters

Unlike simpler tools, you can pre-configure how this tool behaves in your YAML setup:

* **`top_k_results`**: Controls how many search results/snippets to return (e.g., `3`).
* **`lang`**: Sets the language for the Wikipedia search (e.g., `en` for English, `es` for Spanish).

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to integrate Wikipedia search into your agentic network.

### Assign & Configure Tool

In your agent's YAML configuration, add "Wikipedia" to the `tool_assigned` list. You can optionally define the language and number of results here.

**Example Config:**

```yaml
config:
  top_k_results: 3
  lang: en
```

</Step>

### Test the Output

The tool returns text summaries.

* **Usage:** The agent uses this text to answer user questions or perform further reasoning and fulfill the user request.

## 📚 Practical Recipes (Examples)

### Recipe 1: General Knowledge Assistant

> **Use Case:** An agent that answers "Who," "What," and "When" questions using English Wikipedia.

```yaml showLineNumbers
create_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: "Wiki_Lookup_Agent"
    LLM_config:
      params:
        model: "gpt-4o-mini"
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: "Wikipedia"
          config:
            top_k_results: 1
            lang: en
    agent_function:
      - "You are a helpful encyclopedia assistant."
      - "When asked about a topic, use the Wikipedia tool to fetch a summary."
    incoming_edge:
      - Start
    outgoing_edge: []

```

### Recipe 2: International Researcher

> **Use Case:** An agent configured to search for concepts specifically in French Wikipedia.

```yaml showLineNumbers
tools:
  tool_assigned:
    - name: "Wikipedia"
      config:
        top_k_results: 5
        lang: fr

```

## 🚑 Troubleshooting


* **RuntimeError / Connection Issues**
    * This usually indicates a failure to reach the Wikipedia API. Verify if the Wikipedia API is currently down.


* **Irrelevant Results**
    * If the summary returned is not helpful, consider increasing `top_k_results` (default is 3) in the config to give the agent a broader set of snippets to read.
