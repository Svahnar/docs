Scrape and extract textual content from web pages. Provide a `urls` field pointing to the page or pages to scrape.

## Usage

Example payload (single URL):

```yaml
payload:
	urls: "https://example.com/article"
```

Example YAML for assigning the tool to an agent:

```yaml
tools:
	tool_assigned:
		- name: "scrape_webpages"
```

The tool returns extracted document content grouped per page, with basic metadata when available.

### Notes

- Under the hood it uses a WebBaseLoader to fetch and parse pages. Large pages may be truncated by downstream tooling.
