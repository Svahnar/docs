# Zapier

Seamlessly integrate your agents with thousands of apps by triggering **Zapier Zaps**.

This guide will walk you through setting up a Zapier trigger, configuring your agent, and mapping data fields.

## 💡 Core Concepts

To configure this tool, you need to understand two key components.

### 1\. How does this Zapier Trigger work?

The Zapier Trigger tool allows your agent to send a JSON payload to a specific Zap with Zap ID. This initiates workflow (Zap) in Zapier, passing along data like `first_name`, `email`, or any other keys in key-value pairs you define.

### 2\. What is a Zap ID?

The **Zap ID** is the unique identifier for your Zap.

**How to find it:**
1. Create or Edit your Zap in the Zapier editor.
2. Look at your browser's address bar: `https://zapier.com/editor/123456789/draft/...`
3. The number `123456789` is your **Zap ID**.

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to set up the integration from scratch.

### Create a Zap & Select Trigger

  1. Log in to Zapier and click **Create Zap**.
  2. For the **Trigger**, search for and select **"Svahnar"**.
  3. Select **"New Request"** as the Trigger Event.

  </Step>

  <Step>

### Authenticate

  1. Click on **Account**.
  2. You will be asked to sign in to your SVAHNAR account.
  3. Use your **API Key** from the SVAHNAR platform.


  Check the [Quickstart](/docs/GetStarted/Quickstart) to learn how to generate your API Key.
  </Step>

  <Step>

### Configure Trigger

  1.  **Define Data Fields**:
      *   In the "Trigger" section, specify the data fields your agent will send.
      *   Under **Fields**, add the keys (e.g., `first_name`, `email`) that your SVAHNAR agent will include in its payload.

      :::info
      These fields inform Zapier about the expected data, enabling you to map them in subsequent actions.
      :::

  2.  **Enter Zap ID**:
      *   Locate the **Zap ID** field and paste the unique identifier you copied from your Zap's URL (refer to [Core Concepts](#-core-concepts) for details).
  </Step>

  <Step>

### Test & Map

  1. Click **Test trigger**.
  2. Zapier will look for a recent request or use the sample data you provided in the fields configuration.
  3. Verify that you see the data (e.g., `first_name: John`).
  4. Continue to add an **Action** (e.g., Google Sheets, Slack) and map the fields from the trigger to the action.

## 📚 Practical Recipes (Examples)

### Recipe 1: Basic Zapier Trigger Agent

> **Use Case:** An agent that collects user details and sends them to Zapier.

```yaml showLineNumbers
create_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: zapier_agent
    LLM_config:
        params:
          model: gpt-5-nano
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: Zapier_Trigger
          config:
            # Your unique Zap ID
            zap_id: 335989371 
            # Optional: Additional static info to send with every request
            additional_info:
              source: "svahnar_agent"
              environment: "production"
    agent_function:
      - your function is to send the user id, first_name, last_name and email to the zapier.
    incoming_edge:
      - Start
    outgoing_edge: []
```

### 💡 Tip: Sending Additional Info

You can use the `additional_info` block in the tool config to hardcode values that should be sent with every webhook payload, regardless of what the agent dynamically generates.

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

* **Zap not triggering**
    * Check if the **Zap ID** is correct.
    * Ensure the Zap is **ON**.
    * If it still implies, toggle the Zap OFF and back ON to refresh the connection.

* **Missing Data Fields**
    * Ensure your agent's function explicitly mentions the fields it needs to extract and send (e.g., "send first_name and email").
    * Verify that the keys in your Zapier Trigger configuration match exactly what the agent is sending.
