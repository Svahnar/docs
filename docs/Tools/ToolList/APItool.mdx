Call external web APIs using standard HTTP methods. This tool supports GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE and allows passing headers, query parameters, and a JSON body.

With this you can call your own custom APIs and utilize it in agent workflow. Our agent will communicate with your API and use its response as you design  

## Usage

While adding data in agent node you can do it in two way
1. Directly adding values
2. From keyvault

### 1) Direct way

You can nornmally provide value in agent node
For e.g:-
In headers
```
headers:     
  key: "value" 
```
In above headers (keyword) should be as it is and below that start adding your key values after 2 space from newline and value should be enclosed in quotes `"` 

Same will follow for body and params

### 2) Using keyvault

Instead of providing direct values you can pass the values by using placeholders defined as key in your keyvault <br />
For e.g:-<br />
Same in headers if i you have to pass token you can do that using keyvault. Assuming you had added token in you keyvault as AccessToken as key name

Now in agent node in the header part of tool config you can add like this
```
headers:     
  mytoken: "${AccessToken}" 
```
Note:- Placeholder should be enclosed in double quote `"` and starts with dollar symbold `$` followed by curly braces `{}`

### Notes

- The tool merges payload and tool_config. Headers and params can be supplied as YAML/JSON strings or dicts.
- The tool attempts to parse JSON responses; otherwise returns text.

## YAML usage

```yaml showLineNumbers
tools:
  tool_assigned:
    - name: "APItool"
      config:
        url: "https://api.example.com/data"
        http_method: "GET"
```

Invocation payload example:

```yaml showLineNumbers
payload:
  url: "https://api.example.com/users"
  http_method: "get"
  params:
    limit: 5
```

### More details

Headers and params may be provided as YAML strings (they will be parsed) or native maps. The tool uses `httpx` asynchronously and returns parsed JSON when available.

## Agent integration example

```yaml showLineNumbers
create_vertical_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: "api_caller"
    LLM_config:
      params:
        model: "gpt-5-mini"
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: "APItool"
          config:
            url: "https://api.example.com"
    agent_function:
      - "Call the specified external API and return parsed results."
```
