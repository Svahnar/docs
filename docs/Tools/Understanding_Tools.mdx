Tools are external capabilities that an agent (an LLM-driven system) can call to perform actions beyond text generation. They give an LLM practical power: access to up-to-date data, precise computation, side effects (APIs, databases, file systems), and longer-term state.

## How tools empower LLMs
- Extend knowledge: provide current facts (search, web browser, knowledge bases).
- Perform exact work: calculators, spreadsheets, code runners, and validators remove guesswork.
- Take actions: APIs, databases, and OS tools let agents effect changes (create tickets, send emails, deploy).
- Maintain context/state: tools can record or query durable state outside the model context window.

## Roles of tools in an agent
- Observers: retrieve information (search, sensors, logs).
- Actors: perform operations with side effects (API calls, job scheduling).
- Translators/Adapters: convert LLM output to structured inputs or protocol messages.
- Validators: check correctness and enforce constraints (type checkers, linters, test runners).

## Benefits
- Grounding: reduces hallucination by sourcing answers from authoritative tools.
- Accuracy: deterministic tools (math, exact lookup) improve precision.
- Scalability: offload heavy work to specialized services.
- Safety: isolate risky operations and enforce checks before performing side effects.


Example tool manifest (simple):
```json
{
  "name": "search",
  "description": "Web search returning top 5 results",
  "inputSchema": { "query": "string" },
  "outputSchema": { "results": "array" }
}
```


Tools transform an LLM from a text predictor into an actionable, reliable system component. Design them to be explicit, safe, and composable.
