# Add Keys to Keyvault

Adding keys to the Keyvault ensures sensitive values (API keys, credentials, tokens) are securely stored, cryptographically protected, and retrievable only by authorized services.


## Steps to add a key

1. **Navigate to Keyvault**

   * From the **header**, click **Keys**.
   * In the left-hand sidebar, click **Key vault** to open the Keyvault panel.

2. **Click Add Keys**

   * Press the **Create Keys** button.
   * A modal will open where you can enter the key details.

3. **Fill in details**

   * **Key name** → An identifier for your secret (e.g., `tavily_api_key`).
   * **Key Value** → The actual secret value (e.g., your tavily API key string).
   * **Description** *(optional)* → Add context so you remember what this key is for (e.g., *"This is my Tavily API key for authentication"*).

4. **Save**

   * Click **Save** to securely add the key to Keyvault.
   * The secret will now be stored cryptographically.



## Important notes

* **Visibility**: The value is visible only once, at the time of creation. After saving, even the creator cannot view it again.
* **Revocation**: Keys remain stored until explicitly revoked by you.
* **Usage**: Saved keys can be referenced and accessed securely by authorized services in the platform.
* **Description best practice**: Keep descriptions concise but clear to avoid confusion when managing multiple secrets.



## Example

Suppose you want to add a tavily API key:

* **Key name**: `tavily_api_key`
* **Value**: `tvly-3efa3d**...`
* **Description**: `tavily API key for my production app`

Once saved, this key will be securely stored in Keyvault and retrievable by authorized components — but the plaintext value will not be visible again.



## Security tip

Always ensure you paste values directly into the modal from a secure source. Avoid storing them temporarily in text files or sending them over insecure channels.
