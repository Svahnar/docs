Delete an agent that is no longer needed or to remove it permanently. This API allows you to delete an agent by its unique identifier (agent ID).

## Delete single agent

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
from svahnar import Svahnar

client = Svahnar()

response = client.agents.delete(
    agent_id="8bd57aa1-a982-49ba-b6f6-91e84e5dfe9c",
)
print(response)
```

### Request Parameters
- **`agent_id`**: The unique identifier of the agent you want to delete. This ID is assigned when you create the agent.

### Response
```json title="json" showLineNumbers
{
    "message": "Agent with ID '8bd57aa1-a982-49ba-b6f6-91e84e5dfe9c' has been successfully deleted."
}

```

## Delete multiple agents

You can delete multiple agents at once by providing a list of agent IDs. This is useful for bulk deletion of agents that are no longer needed.

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
from svahnar import Svahnar

client = Svahnar()

response = client.agents.delete_multiple(
    agent_ids=["f8a204bc-f118-404d-b7c4-6e930fb7c154", "e416f278-8d38-4096-9daa-f75de4134c48"],
)
print(response)
```
### Request Parameters
- **`agent_ids`**: A list of unique identifiers of the agents you want to delete. Each ID is assigned when you create the agent.



### Response

``` json title="json" showLineNumbers

    "message": "The following agents have been successfully deleted: f8a204bc-f118-404d-b7c4-6e930fb7c154, e416f278-8d38-4096-9daa-f75de4134c48"
