sidebarTitle: "Run Agent"
description: "Execute a specific agent to perform its designated tasks."
---

To execute the agents you deployed, you can use the following code. This API allows you to run a specific agent and perform its designated tasks. You can also specify the input data for the agent to process.

:::info
**Agent Access Control** (only for Teams and Enterprise plans): If you are using the Teams or Enterprise plan, you can set up access control for your agents. This allows you to restrict access to specific users or groups within your organization. You can manage access control settings through the SVAHNAR Platform.


:::

### Basic Execution (Without History)

Use this for single-turn tasks where context from previous messages is not required.

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
from svahnar import Svahnar

client = Svahnar()
response = client.agents.run(
    agent_id="b06b8e39-51a7-4b6a-8474-e6340a6b9fa6",
    message="Tell me about Stargate Project"
)
print(response)
```

{/* ### With Agent History

To maintain context across multiple interactions (e.g., a chatbot), you must pass the `agent_history` parameter.

:::tip
For detailed instructions on how to construct and manage the `agent_history` structure, please refer to the **[Chat History Guide](./chat_history.mdx)**.
:::

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
from svahnar import Svahnar

client = Svahnar()

# 'chat_history' should be constructed using the generate_chat_history helper
# or formatted manually as a list of dictionaries.
# See docs/Agents/chat_history.mdx for details.

response = client.agents.run(
    agent_id="b06b8e39-51a7-4b6a-8474-e6340a6b9fa6",
    message="What are the key goals?",
    agent_history=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about Stargate Project"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Information search agent - The Stargate Project is..."}
    ]
)
print(response)
``` */}

### Request Parameters
- **`agent_id`**: The unique identifier of the agent you want to execute. This ID is assigned when you create the agent.
- **`message`**: The input data or message you want to send to the agent for processing. Currently it only supports string input.
{/* - **`agent_history`**: Optional. JSON‐encoded list of prior messages; defaults to empty list. */}
