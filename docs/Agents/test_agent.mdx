You can tempororily test the functionality of an agent using the following code. This API allows you to run a specific agent and perform its designated tasks. You can also specify the input data for the agent to process.

:::info
When working with complex agent configurations:
- The process of building and responding may require additional time
- Use the timeout parameter to accommodate longer processing times
- Adjust the timeout value as needed based on your configuration complexity
:::

## With YAML file

You can test the agent using a YAML file. This is useful for testing complex agents in a single YAML file.

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
from svahnar import Svahnar
from pathlib import Path

client = Svahnar()

response = client.agents.test(
    yaml_file=Path("agent.yaml"),
    message="Tell me about the Stargate Project",
    timeout=600     # 5 minutes
)

print(response)
```
## With YAML string

You can use a YAML string to test the agent. This is useful for quick tests or when you don't want to create a separate YAML file.

```python title="Python" showLineNumbers
from svahnar import Svahnar

client = Svahnar()

response = client.agents.test(
    yaml_string="""create_vertical_agent_network:
  agent-1:
    agent_name: information search agent
    agent_function:
      - It is used to search for the information on web or internet and provide the result
    LLM_config:
      params:
        model: gpt-4o-mini
        temperature: 0.5
        max_tokens: 1000
        request_timeout: 600
    tools:
      tool_assigned:
        - name: Tavily
    incoming_edge:
      - Start
    outgoing_edge: []
    """,
    message="Tell me about the Stargate Project",
    timeout=600  # Adjusted timeout for processing
)

print(response)
```
## Request Parameters

- **`yaml_string`**: The YAML configuration string that defines the agent's context and settings.
- **`message`**: The input data or message you want to send to the agent for processing. Currently it only supports string input.
- **`timeout`**: The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the agent to respond. This is useful for complex agents that may take longer to process.

### Response

You get same response as [executing the agent](./run_agent#response).
