description: Retrieve detailed information about a specific agent, including its configuration.

Throughout the documentation, with Agents you will be using Agent ID which will be a UUID. It is a 36-character string that uniquely identifies the agent. It is generated when you create an agent and can be found in the response while you're creating the agent or by listing all agents.

You can use the agent ID to retrieve detailed information about a specific agent, including its configuration.
